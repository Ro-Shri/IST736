'let\'s say you live at the end of an airport runway . \nlarge jetliners continuously pass over your house , rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace . \nlet\'s say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances , and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home . \nnow let\'s say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it\'s worth . \nwouldn\'t you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ? \nof course you would . \nbut what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ? \nthat\'s what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he\'s happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it\'s not for sale . \nunfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice . \nnot about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back . \nthe castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i\'ve seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest . \nin fact , it is this film\'s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful . \nthe good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets . \nit\'s the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn\'t have to think all that much while watching this film . \ni just sat back and enjoyed myself . \nthe situation is one we\'ve seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever . \nwhat makes this film different is its characters . \ndarryl thinks he\'s got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he\'s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) ," and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard . \nsteve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for \"" investments \"" like jousting sticks and overhead projectors ", while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto\'s incompetent courtroom maneuvers . \nthe great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren\'t so stupid that they get annoying . \nthey\'re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing . \nwe look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection . \nscreenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans . \nsympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family\'s wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them . \ni suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works . \ni particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs . \ndon\'t get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius . \nit\'s just that too often , a film will resort to it\'s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully . \ninstead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world . \nwhen they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious . \none of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . \nthe kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film\'s running time . \nluckily , it\'s a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film\'s main drive , is still quite enjoyable . \nwith all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes . \ni\'m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate . \nand , for that matter , it\'s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this . \n',pos

'let\'s say you live at the end of an airport runway . \nlarge jetliners continuously pass over your house , rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace . \nlet\'s say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances , and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home . \nnow let\'s say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it\'s worth . \nwouldn\'t you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ? \nof course you would . \nbut what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ? \nthat\'s what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he\'s happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it\'s not for sale . \nunfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice . \nnot about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back . \nthe castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i\'ve seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest . \nin fact , it is this film\'s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful . \nthe good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets . \nit\'s the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn\'t have to think all that much while watching this film . \ni just sat back and enjoyed myself . \nthe situation is one we\'ve seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever . \nwhat makes this film different is its characters . \ndarryl thinks he\'s got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he\'s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) ," and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard . \nsteve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for \"" investments \"" like jousting sticks and overhead projectors ", while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto\'s incompetent courtroom maneuvers . \nthe great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren\'t so stupid that they get annoying . \nthey\'re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing . \nwe look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection . \nscreenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans . \nsympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family\'s wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them . \ni suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works . \ni particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs . \ndon\'t get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius . \nit\'s just that too often , a film will resort to it\'s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully . \ninstead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world . \nwhen they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious . \none of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . \nthe kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film\'s running time . \nluckily , it\'s a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film\'s main drive , is still quite enjoyable . \nwith all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes . \ni\'m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate . \nand , for that matter , it\'s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this . \n',pos

'in this good natured , pleasent and easy going comedy , bill murray ( ghostbusters , 1984 ) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners , who , every year , is sent to punxsutawney , p . a , to report on groundhog day . \nthe groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box , and if he dosen\'t see a shadow , it will be an early spring . \nphil really hates the ceremony , and not even his producer rita ( macdowell ) can change his mind . \nhowever , fate has a cruel trick for phil , and he starts re-living groundhog day over , and over , and over , until he gradually likes it , and rita falls in love with him . \ngroundhog day is a well written , totatly unoffensive and funny comedy . \nthe screenwriters , director ramis and danny rubin , have written a funny , warm , but never overly senitmental comedy . \nalthough the idea of a day repeating over and over may sound tedious , there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film . \nramis\'s direction also helps , and although he dosen\'t try any flash director tricks , the film is directed well enough , and the jokes are set up well . \nand the editing is also good , especially when it shows one part of the day over , and over again , such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita . \nthe performances are also excellent . \nbill murray is great fun , and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth , and delivers his lines in his usual smary style . \nandie macdowell is good as rita , although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film . \nthere is chemistry between the two leads , thankfully , otherwise the whole film would probably fall part . \nchris elliot , as the cameraman larry , is also funny , although you have to like his goofy style , otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film , and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall . \nthe supporting cast aren\'t bad either , with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson , and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist . \nin fact , there is not one dud performance in this film , and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase . \noverall , there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all . \nit almost seems perfect . \nhowever , the film can get a bit soppy sometimes , and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over , and over , and over , and over . \nalso , there\'s not much of an music score , and the music there is is pretty bad . \nbut these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all . \noverall , then , groundhog day is a funny , smart , and also has some room in there for some heart . \nan excellent comedy . \noverall rating= ( \n',pos

'in this good natured , pleasent and easy going comedy , bill murray ( ghostbusters , 1984 ) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners , who , every year , is sent to punxsutawney , p . a , to report on groundhog day . \nthe groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box , and if he dosen\'t see a shadow , it will be an early spring . \nphil really hates the ceremony , and not even his producer rita ( macdowell ) can change his mind . \nhowever , fate has a cruel trick for phil , and he starts re-living groundhog day over , and over , and over , until he gradually likes it , and rita falls in love with him . \ngroundhog day is a well written , totatly unoffensive and funny comedy . \nthe screenwriters , director ramis and danny rubin , have written a funny , warm , but never overly senitmental comedy . \nalthough the idea of a day repeating over and over may sound tedious , there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film . \nramis\'s direction also helps , and although he dosen\'t try any flash director tricks , the film is directed well enough , and the jokes are set up well . \nand the editing is also good , especially when it shows one part of the day over , and over again , such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita . \nthe performances are also excellent . \nbill murray is great fun , and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth , and delivers his lines in his usual smary style . \nandie macdowell is good as rita , although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film . \nthere is chemistry between the two leads , thankfully , otherwise the whole film would probably fall part . \nchris elliot , as the cameraman larry , is also funny , although you have to like his goofy style , otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film , and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall . \nthe supporting cast aren\'t bad either , with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson , and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist . \nin fact , there is not one dud performance in this film , and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase . \noverall , there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all . \nit almost seems perfect . \nhowever , the film can get a bit soppy sometimes , and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over , and over , and over , and over . \nalso , there\'s not much of an music score , and the music there is is pretty bad . \nbut these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all . \noverall , then , groundhog day is a funny , smart , and also has some room in there for some heart . \nan excellent comedy . \noverall rating= ( \n',pos

'i\'m really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . \nsure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god\'s green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out . \nthe crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff . \nhideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . \nclueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time . \nand people have e-mailed me too ," saying clueless is a good movie and that i\'m the only one who doesn\'t like it . \none girl said if i\'d seen the movie with \"" an open mind "," \"" i would have enjoyed it . \nnothing could be further from the truth . \ni went into the theater expecting to love the movie . \nthe preview looked good and of course i\'m crazymadinlove with alicia ", but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters . \nalmost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . \nwhen we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn\'t me ) yelled out ," \"" that was the worst f$&#in\' movie i\'ve ever seen \"" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . \nso last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia\'s pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter . \ni knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i\'ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . \nwhat i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . \nand you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . \nwhere to begin in criticizing this movie ? \nthe plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier ", the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she\'s still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever . \nthere is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . \nzero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . \nso why does this movie get one star out of me ? \nwell , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . \nand if it wasn\'t bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get . \nalicia plays a babysitter who\'s spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party . \nand of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) . \nas the movie trods along , we discover she\'s not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character\'s fantasies ( and probably every male viewer\'s too ) . \nthe drunken father thinks she\'s just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she\'s taking her bubble bath . \nthey even throw in the middle aged wife\'s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . \nnot that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy . \nat least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated . \nin fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there\'s absolutely no nudity in it . \nso you can\'t call it a sex flick . \ni\'ve already pointed out that it can\'t fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ? \nbad . \n',neg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'i\'m really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . \nsure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god\'s green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out . \nthe crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff . \nhideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . \nclueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time . \nand people have e-mailed me too ," saying clueless is a good movie and that i\'m the only one who doesn\'t like it . \none girl said if i\'d seen the movie with \"" an open mind "," \"" i would have enjoyed it . \nnothing could be further from the truth . \ni went into the theater expecting to love the movie . \nthe preview looked good and of course i\'m crazymadinlove with alicia ", but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters . \nalmost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . \nwhen we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn\'t me ) yelled out ," \"" that was the worst f$&#in\' movie i\'ve ever seen \"" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . \nso last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia\'s pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter . \ni knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i\'ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . \nwhat i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . \nand you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . \nwhere to begin in criticizing this movie ? \nthe plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier ", the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she\'s still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever . \nthere is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . \nzero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . \nso why does this movie get one star out of me ? \nwell , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . \nand if it wasn\'t bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get . \nalicia plays a babysitter who\'s spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party . \nand of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) . \nas the movie trods along , we discover she\'s not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character\'s fantasies ( and probably every male viewer\'s too ) . \nthe drunken father thinks she\'s just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she\'s taking her bubble bath . \nthey even throw in the middle aged wife\'s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . \nnot that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy . \nat least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated . \nin fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there\'s absolutely no nudity in it . \nso you can\'t call it a sex flick . \ni\'ve already pointed out that it can\'t fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ? \nbad . \n',neg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ? \nwell , whatever it is , you\'d sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we\'re left with here . \nthis is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! \nit\'s like i said . . . this \nmovie sucks . \nplot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . \ncritique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . \nuneven , would be another . \nthe trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes ," all leading you to believe that it\'s actually going to go \"" somewhere \"" . \nbut it isn\'t long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral ", features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet ," tries too hard to get us into the \"" pain \"" of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix . \nin a sci-fi movie ? \nwell ", i don\'t know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement . \nultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise ," joins the crew in their \"" misadventures in space \"" for the main crux of its journey ", and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact . \nmind you , if you enjoyed that film\'s shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well . \nof course , i don\'t remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story . \nugh . \nwhat a friggin\' mess . \nfilms like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again . \ndidn\'t anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? \ndidn\'t they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain\'t saying much ! ) . \nof course , you can\'t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o\'connell in this fine crew of thespians . \n\'nuff said . \nneither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film\'s musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my \nears hurt ! ) . \nso is anything salvageable in this movie ? \nsure . \ngary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn\'t completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes ," the \"" sand-twister \"" effect that you see in the commercial is well done . \nother than that ? \ni guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops "," \ndid i say \"" admire \"" "," i meant \"" am disgusted \"" ! \nall in all ", this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it\'s just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck . \ngo see the ninth gate . . . now \nthere\'s a great movie ! \nand on a personal note , i think it\'s time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting . \n',neg,,,,,,,,,,

'so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ? \nwell , whatever it is , you\'d sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we\'re left with here . \nthis is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! \nit\'s like i said . . . this \nmovie sucks . \nplot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . \ncritique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . \nuneven , would be another . \nthe trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes ," all leading you to believe that it\'s actually going to go \"" somewhere \"" . \nbut it isn\'t long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral ", features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet ," tries too hard to get us into the \"" pain \"" of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix . \nin a sci-fi movie ? \nwell ", i don\'t know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement . \nultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise ," joins the crew in their \"" misadventures in space \"" for the main crux of its journey ", and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact . \nmind you , if you enjoyed that film\'s shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well . \nof course , i don\'t remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story . \nugh . \nwhat a friggin\' mess . \nfilms like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again . \ndidn\'t anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? \ndidn\'t they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain\'t saying much ! ) . \nof course , you can\'t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o\'connell in this fine crew of thespians . \n\'nuff said . \nneither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film\'s musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my \nears hurt ! ) . \nso is anything salvageable in this movie ? \nsure . \ngary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn\'t completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes ," the \"" sand-twister \"" effect that you see in the commercial is well done . \nother than that ? \ni guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops "," \ndid i say \"" admire \"" "," i meant \"" am disgusted \"" ! \nall in all ", this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it\'s just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck . \ngo see the ninth gate . . . now \nthere\'s a great movie ! \nand on a personal note , i think it\'s time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting . \n',neg,,,,,,,,,,

neg,what you get whe you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such close encounters the third kind space odyssey apollo and contact well whatever youd sure hell hope that would thousand times better tha this shoddy attempt such melange considering the disastrous results were left with here this film that takes little bit everything but ultimately adds lot othing it like said this movie sucks plot rescue crew astronauts sent dow mars the year after unknow energy force leads loss contact with the previous gang space aviators visit the red planet critique extremely underwhelming the best way describe this movie uneve would another the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise the around had bee so-so and eve the film itself starts off with decent first twenty minutes all leading you believe that it actually going somewhere but isnt long before the entire movie downshifts into eutral features more space walks tha anything interesting the cherry-colored planet tries too hard get into the pai some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix sci-fi movie well dont know much just seemed like bunch erdies talking techie jargo for about hour and half only figure out some big secret the end secret which practically had yawning with excitement ultimately this movie that starts off with decent premise joins the crew their misadventures space for the mai crux its journey and eventually settles dow for one the most anti-climactic endings this side contact mind you you enjoyed that film shrug-of-the-shoulders ending you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty well course dont remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects its end story ugh what friggin mess films like this generally get wondering about the brass hollywood agai didnt anybody recognize the crappiness this script didnt they read the bad dialogue the cheezy lines the obvious derivative ature the work mind you with director like depalma the helm that aint saying much course you cant really blame the brass for the inclusio jerry oconnell this fine crew thespians nuff said either you blame them for depalma cranking the juice the film musical score during the last fiftee minutes presumably order wake the audience okay get bria this scene supposed powerful wow yaw ears hurt anything salvageable this movie sure gary sinise does another great job does cheadle the film doesnt completely bore you much just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening and yes the sand-twister effect that you see the commercial well done other tha that guess could say that admire how filmmakers have become much more devious their product placement strategies oops did say admire meant disgusted all all this movie delivers very little actual substance offers two-bit dialogue masked lot sci-fi mumbo-jumbo pretends deep whe really it just sappy and eventually just settles into ending which other tha presenting with pathetic computer graphic part the story gives little more think about tha how might able get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck see the inth gate there great movie and personal ote think it time for depalma stop worrying much about his proverbial uninterrupted film sequences and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting

'the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film\'s end . \nif you\'re not familiar with this law , then maybe you\'ve seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film\'s end . \nnow if you\'re a regular reader of mine , you\'ve heard me say this countless times : you know how drive me crazy is going to end , but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ? \nno ," it definitely is not . \nmelissa joan hart ( from abc\'s \"" sabrina "," the teenage witch \"" ) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team . \nadrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who\'s just broken up with his activist girlfriend . \napparently he wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous enough to take him back ", and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance . \nso the two pretend to date for some reason , but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud . \nwill grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends ? \nwill this crazy scheme work ? \ndo i care ? \nthe teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy . \nwhat makes movies like can\'t hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work ( and to a lesser extent , she\'s all that and never been kissed ) is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly . \ni don\'t know what the writer\'s intention was with drive me crazy . \nthere was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to . \nhere there\'s nothing . . . \njust teens whining about who\'s going to take them to the big dance . \ndo me a favor kids , go get a job or something . . . \njust shut the hell up . \nin all honesty ," the best part of this film is the end credits . \nnow normally when i say that it\'s followed with the joke \"" . . . because the movie is finally over . \"" \nin this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film . \nafter the obligatory second playing of britney spears\' titular song ", there\'s a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school . \nnothing great ," but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them . \nsci-fi fans take note : there are brief appearances from stephen collins ( star trek : the motion picture ) and faye grant ( the tv miniseries \"" v \"" and \"" v : the final battle \"" ) . \n[pg-13] \n'",neg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
