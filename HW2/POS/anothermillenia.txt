I. loved. this. movie.
Even if it was a Christmas movie, it wasn't kitschy and it wasn't like the usual Christmas movies. It was also funny to see how a person from the 14th century would behave in this day and age. It was hilarious! ("Lady Alexa Plays" LMAO) The chemistry between the two was also right.
And at the end you get knocked over again with "Production: Vanessa Hudgens". Yes girl!!
