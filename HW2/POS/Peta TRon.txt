I tought it would be horrible, I don't like the romantic stories with a person from another time. I was not right, I loved it. Yes, it's a simple romcom where a girl meets a boy and they fall in love uuu what a plot. I don't care, for me it's more than enough. They are adorable, there are funny scenes and well, it's a Christmas film. I missed some details, I mean, it has sense like it is but maybe explaining more some things.
