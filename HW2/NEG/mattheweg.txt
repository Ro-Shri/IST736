I am strangely hypnotized by these awful Christmas movies. It’s a huge genre of crappy throwaway garbage that we never talk about in polite circles yet are loved enough to keep getting made. This is truly dreadful: bad acting, writing, directing, costumes, just pretty much everything you can name about it. Hudgens has a certain glow about her but she’s obviously gone off the deep end of fame and she just doesn’t work as a real person anymore. The guy is sort of a weird mix of Brendan Fraser and Pete from Mad Men but not as appealing or interesting as that sounds. And of course this is just about having something on while you do whatever it is that you do while you have something like this on but man, what even is this? What are movies anyway? What are we doing with our lives watching all this shit? These are the kinds of things you’re forced to think about when you watch movies like this.
