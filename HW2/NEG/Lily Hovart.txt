Oh it’s just... unbearably bad. Like it’s hardly funny bad, it’s just bad.

There’s absolutely no flavor in this movie at a l l. Scenes go by with several moments of silence, dialogue is dry and weird, acting is paced really weird, it’s just awful. 

We laughed a couple times at the absurdity of this being made and released as a real film, but never because the movie was actually enjoyable. It just... sucked. It was just really bad.
