Not that I had high expectations for this, but I can't get over how this movie is basically a soulless, boring, tacky Christmas remake of the original Thor movie with less interesting characters. That is literally the plot. It's Thor. They even have a scene where the knight drinks hot chocolate at a diner and loudly and abrasively demands another. At least if you're going to remake Thor, be Kenneth Branagh and make it decent.
