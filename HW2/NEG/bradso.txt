Legitimately one of the worst motion pictures I have ever seen. Blandly directed and not much better acted, with zero chemistry between the leads and a plot that is basically nonsense. The characters make no sense, the script sets up conflicts and challenges that are abandoned, and there are roughly a half dozen characters who have multiple scenes but no reason to be in the movie at all. The longest 90 minutes of my recent life.
