I feel like I just woke up from a 90 minute long fever dream and I'm never getting that time back. Seriously what actually just happened. I'm pretty sure the writing team came up with a title then just rolled a bunch of dice to decide on all the plot points.

Also, Vanessa Hudgens is an angel, but why would you let someone who is either a) an actual knight with no driving experience, or b) someone with severe amnesia, drive your car??
